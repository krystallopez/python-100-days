    # This is equal to the previous position plus the shift amount. For example if the letter is h, the letter 'h' has an index of 7 in the alphabet list. we would add 7 to 5, which is 12 which encodes the letter h to be the 12th index of the alphabet list, which would be the letter 'm. This would follow suit for each letter in plain_text.

# This is the same process as for the encrypt except we are subtracting the shift_amount and changing the empty string variable to plain text.

# This conditional will check to see of the user wants to decrypt or encrypt a word based on whether or not they type in "encode" or "decode". If the user types in "encode", then the word they entered will be encrypted, if the user types in "decode" then the word they entered in will be decrypted

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Instructions- Encryption
#TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.
#TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
#e.g. 
#plain_text = "hello"
#shift = 5
#cipher_text = "mjqqt"
#print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"

##üêõBug alert: What happens if you try to encode the word 'civilization'?üêõ

#TODO-3: Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message. 

#Instructions- Decryption
#TODO-1: Create a different function called 'decrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.

  #TODO-2: Inside the 'decrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' *backwards* in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the decrypted text.  
  #e.g. 
  #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
  #shift = 5
  #plain_text = "hello"
  #print output: "The decoded text is hello"


#TODO-3: Check if the user wanted to encrypt or decrypt the message by checking the 'direction' variable. Then call the correct function based on that 'drection' variable. You should be able to test the code to encrypt *AND* decrypt a message.
